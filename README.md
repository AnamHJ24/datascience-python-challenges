# Python Party – Data Science Challenges 🎉🐍

This repository contains my solutions to the **Python Party** challenges hosted by [InterviewMaster.ai](https://interviewmaster.ai).  
Each day features a new **data science** problem, solved using **Python** with a focus on clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

## 📌 About the Challenge
The Python Party is a fun and educational daily coding event where participants solve data science problems using Python.  
It’s a great way to improve problem-solving skills, explore data manipulation techniques, and practice algorithms in a hands-on manner.
