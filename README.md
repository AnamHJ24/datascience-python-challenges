# Python Party – Data Science Challenges 🎉🐍

This repository contains my solutions to the **Python Party** challenges hosted by [InterviewMaster.ai](https://interviewmaster.ai).  
Each day features a new **data science** problem, solved using **Python** with a focus on clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
